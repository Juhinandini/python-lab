        ": Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages. Python is Interpreted Python is Interactive Python is Object-Oriented Python is a Beginner's Language Python Programming Running Python Scripts Running Python in THREE ways: a) Running Python Interpreter b) Running Python Scripts in IDLE c) Running python scripts in Command Prompt a) Running Python Interpreter: Python comes with an interactive interpreter. When you type python in your shell or command prompt, the python interpreter becomes active with a >>> prompt and waits for your commands b) Running Python Scripts in IDLE: . Go to File menu click on New File (CTRL+N) and write the code and save first.py c) Running python scripts in Command Prompt: · Before going to run we have to check the PATH in environment variables.\n",
